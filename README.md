##### About Me

My name is Jacquelyn, but I go by Jackie

I'm 29 years old, born and raised in Miami, Florida

I graduated from Florida State University with a major
in English and a minor in computer science

After graduation, I moved to South Korea for 4 years where I 
taught English as a second language in both middle and
elementary school

I've never worked in tech so I'm looking forward to breaking into
the industry
